## What Does "Bypass Captcha" Really Mean?

**Bypassing captcha** means finding legitimate ways to avoid or solve these tests **automatically**, so you don’t waste time on repetitive prompts.

Here are the common techniques I’ve used:

- ⚙️ **Automated Solvers**: Tools or browser extensions that solve captchas in the background.
- 🧠 **Behavioral Adjustments**: Browsing like a real human (avoiding bots/scripts) helps prevent triggering captchas.
- 🌐 **Use of Proxies or VPNs**: Captchas are often triggered by suspicious or flagged IP addresses. Using **[9Proxy](https://the9proxy.short.gy/home-github-james2k4)** reduces that risk significantly.
